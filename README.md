# # Fortune500History
Project for Code Louisville Data Analytics 1 Course - History of Companies in Fortune 500

The purpose of this project is to study the historical trends in the Fortune 500. The Fortune 500 is a list of United States corporation ranked based on their revenue for a given fiscal year. The list first begain in 1955, and has continued each year to the present day. Using data gathered since the list's inception, I was able to gain some insight into the history of the Fortune 500.

Primarily, this project was used as a way to learn an practice my coding skills. As I continue my education, I hope to return to this project to take a deeper look at the data and analyze it in more complex and interesting ways.

# Code Louisville Project Requirements
1. Read data in - I read in data from a local csv using pandas. 
2. Manipulate and clean your data - I utilized both built-in pandas functions and lambdas to mainpulate the data.
3. Analyze your data - I used a number of built in python and pandas functions to find in out information about the data.
4. Visualize your data - I created multiple ploys using matplotlib.
5. Interpret your data and graphical output - Since the main component is in a Jupyter notebook, I used markdown cells to explain my code throughout the project.

# Running the project
1. Download this repo or clone `https://github.com/jgroeschen/KFoSs-PC.git`
2. It is recommended, but not required, to created and activate a virtual environment to run the program and not affect your current settings and installations.
3. Use pip to install required modules. The modules needed are `pandas` `numpy` and `matplotlib`, as well as Jupter Notebook.
Alternatively, use pip to install the `requirements.txt`
Usually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb` in your prefered code editor. Visual Studio Code was used in the production of the project. Run all cells of the notebook.
